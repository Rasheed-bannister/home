Interested in data science, creating software to solve problems, and learning how to socialize with humans. Other humans, I mean. I am a human too.

# Experience
## LFB Plasma - _Manager of Strategic Projects and Initiatives_
###### October 2021 - Present
<div class="notice--success"><p>Responsible for managing the developement and implementation of projects.</p></div>

## ImmunoTek Biocenters - _Center Director_
###### October 2017 - October 2021
<div class="notice--success"><p>Responsible for managing the day-to-day operations and business development strategies for a high-producing plasma center. The performance of my center set the standard for the compliant production of Normal Source Plasma. My center was never issued a Major finding in any regulatory or customer audit.

Additionally, my center served as the locus for training of Operations and Quality leadership for new centers prior to their opening. This required unparalleled vigilance over the performance of others, while as many as 12 trainees “drove” production in the center at one time.

I also served as the pilot center for new initiatives and processes, which allowed me the opportunity to analyze and revise SOP’s, training programs, and design implementation strategies and the metrics by which success would be measured. Upon rollout, I would train the leadership for the rest of the fleet and act as a SME to troubleshoot questions as they arose.</p></div>
